# Proforce_Front

##Welcome to Proforce App Project / Frontend

###What is this about ?
Proforce is the app that emerged to automate a tedious and error prone task of complining quality documentation in Industrial Projects.
The main concept is to get a template based engine that allows for easy maniuplation of externally fed documents (often in form of a PDF) and provide an uniform way to quickly quality doc compilations that are often very large and cumbersone when handled manually.

###What is the state of the app ?
Currently, the Proforce app is in it's very early stages. It will be developed further as a hobby.

###How to run it ?
In order to run the frontend layer, copy the repo and run the gradle wrapper.
The frontend layer is currently not deployed.

###Where is the back ?
The back can be found in the other proforce repository, under the following adress:
